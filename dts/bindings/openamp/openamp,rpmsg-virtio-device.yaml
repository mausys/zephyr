      WQ priority for the instance. This property is an array composed by the
      priority level and the type of priority (PRIO_COOP for cooperative or
      PRIO_PREEMPT for preemptive).

      For example for a thread priority K_PRIO_COOP(1) in DT we have
        priority = <1 PRIO_COOP>;
      or for K_PRIO_PREEMPT(2)
        priority = <2 PRIO_PREEMPT>;

      When this property is missing a default priority of <0 PRIO_PREEMPT> is
      assumed.
